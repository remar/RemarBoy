RemarBoy - Interactive Game Boy Rom Analyzer and Game Builder
-------------------------------------------------------------

The very broad idea is to make a system that can take a Game Boy rom
apart and then put it together again.

It should be taken apart in logical parts such as code, graphics, and
sound. The analysis will have to be performed interactively with the
help of a "smart" emulator.

The next step would be to assemble a rom from the various parts. In
between it would of course be possible to modify the parts to create
some kind of "rom hack", although this will be a complete rebuild.

I'm thinking that I can use Eclipse as a base and create plugins to
perform various tasks in rom-creation. We'll see.

A couple of the steps that might be part of this development process:

1. Make a very competent disassembler (with integrated emulator)
2. Make this disassembler able to pick out the graphics and sound parts
3. Store the disassembly in a way that will allow a program to reassemble
   the various parts
4. Create editors for code, graphics, and sound
5. ?
6. Profit!
